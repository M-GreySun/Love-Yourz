                    This is a simple and cute project about myself. 
                    For some reason I felt bold enough to share these things about myself.

                    I don't really like telling others about myself. I foolishy believe 
                    that people can figure out what I need and want just by observing me.
                    To be honest, I only ever spill my thoughts and feelings when I'm shaken 
                    or distrubed. Under the right circumstances I completely explode.

                    I'm also petty, I don't forget, and I rarely forgive.
                    These are things that I acknowledge about myself and I'm not
                    afraid to admit that. It's just part of who I am.
