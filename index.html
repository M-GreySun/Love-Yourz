                    This is a simple and cute project about myself. 
                    For some reason I felt bold enough to share these things about myself.
                    I hope you enjoy.

                Soda: I don't really think telling other about myself.
                I only spill my thoughts and feelings when I'm shaken or distrubed.
                Under the right circumstances I completely explode.

            <p>
                Water: Typically described as plain. However it can on many forms.
                Water takes on the shape of it's container. Sometimes I
                I go above and beyond to please other. So much to I'm not always sure
                who I trully am.
