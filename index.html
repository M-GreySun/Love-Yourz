                    This is a simple and cute project about myself. 
                    For some reason I felt bold enough to share these things about myself.
                    I hope you enjoy.

                    I don't really like telling others about myself. I foolishy believe

                    To be honest, I only ever spill my thoughts and feelings when I'm shaken 
                    or distrubed. Under the right circumstances I completely explode.
